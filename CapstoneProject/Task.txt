Function:
1. Scanning either QR or custom code - Partially Done (only custom grid scanning works; QR not integrated yet)
2. Can read the code - Done (grid-to-ID parsing works correctly)
3. Add savefile like JSON with the database - Done (JSON save file exists and works on PC & mobile)
4. Read and write saves file - Done (can save, remove, and read correctly)
5. Assign data from the JSON correctly with ID of either QR or custom code - Done (ID mapping works)
6. Adding scan UI (info and scan button) - Done (UI exists but styling is basic)
7. Adding info UI (save, remove, and "x" button) - Done (functionality works; buttons work)
8. AR object in real world with the data - Partially Done (spawns correctly but only updates on manual scan)
9. (Optional) Maybe make the scanning automatically with 5s delay - Not Done (still manual only)

UI/UX:
1. Font change to like Android Studio / JetBrains Mono - Done (default now using jetbrains mono font)
2. Home menu which contains scan option QR or custom code - Not Done (no home menu implemented)
3. AR panel looks ugly, maybe dark theme with blurred background like Win11 taskbar - Not Done (plain UI, no blur/dark theme)
4. Info UI form looks ugly, maybe dark theme with simple layout & slick design - Not Done (buttons and form are barebone)
5. Maybe simple transition between menu and UI - Not Done (no transition yet)
6. Button looks ugly and barebone, maybe smooth corners and SVG icons instead of text - Not Done (still basic Unity buttons)

Bugs:
1. Currently AR panel only updates after pressing scan button and not automatically after save or "x" in info UI - Not Done / Partially (manual update works but auto-update not implemented)
