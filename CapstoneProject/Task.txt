Function:
1. Scanning either QR or custom code - Partially Done (only custom grid scanning works; QR not integrated yet)
2. Can read the code - Done (grid-to-ID parsing works correctly)
3. Add savefile like JSON with the database - Done (JSON save file exists and works on PC & mobile)
4. Read and write saves file - Done (can save, remove, and read correctly)
5. Assign data from the JSON correctly with ID of either QR or custom code - Done (ID mapping works)
6. Adding scan UI (info and scan button) - Done (UI exists but styling is basic)
7. Adding info UI (save, remove, and "x" button) - Done (functionality works; buttons work)
8. AR object in real world with the data - Partially Done (spawns correctly but only updates on manual scan)
9. (Optional) Maybe make the scanning automatically with 5s delay - Not Done (still manual only)
10. The scanarea(gameobject) make it follow the marker but it still ui not in world space. (scanarea follow marker but the scan is still not yet completed).
11. Expiry input have 3 form, and it jump beetween form after each input. When saving automatically added "-".


UI/UX:
1. Font change to like Android Studio / JetBrains Mono - Done (default now using jetbrains mono font)
2. Home menu which contains scan option QR or custom code - Not Done (no home menu implemented)
3. AR panel looks ugly, maybe dark theme with blurred background like Win11 taskbar - Not Done (plain UI, no blur/dark theme)
4. Info UI form looks ugly, maybe dark theme with simple layout & slick design - Not Done (buttons and form are barebone)
5. Maybe simple transition between menu and UI - Not Done (no transition yet)
6. Button looks ugly and barebone, maybe smooth corners and SVG icons instead of text - Not Done (still basic Unity buttons)
7. Adding status bar on top middle, show the status of the app either the id or the code. 

Bugs:
1. Currently AR panel only updates after pressing scan button and not automatically after save or "x" in info UI - Not Done / Partially (manual update works but auto-update not implemented).
2. Save file json only being saved and work after restart on pc but on mobile not saved after exiting the app.
